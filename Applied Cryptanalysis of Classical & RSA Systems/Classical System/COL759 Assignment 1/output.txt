Plaintext: In a small coastal town, there lived a fisherman named Luca. He was known for his kindness and deep love for the sea. Every day, before the sun rose, Luca would set out in his weathered boat, navigating the misty waters to catch fish for the village. His life was simple but fulfilling, and the sea was his closest companion. One morning, as Luca cast his net into the water, he felt an unusual resistance. He pulled with all his strength, expecting a large catch, but when he hauled the net onto the boat, he found something extraordinary—a golden fish shimmering in the morning light. The fish was unlike any Luca had ever seen, with scales that sparkled like sunlight on water. As he reached to touch it, the fish looked at him with eyes that seemed almost human, filled with a strange intelligence. Luca was mesmerized, but as he contemplated what to do, the fish began to speak in a voice as soft as a whispering breeze.
